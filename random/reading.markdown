Rated out of 10
<br /><br />

-[White Nights](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1772910.White_Nights): 9
<br />
Immensely poignant and touching. Really makes you feel and relate to the emotions of the narrator, and it seems every other paragraph has some amazingly either a) relatable, or b) novel idea/thought in it.
<br /><br/>

-[Storm of Steel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240485.Storm_of_Steels): 8.5
<br />
What soldiers experienced can be mind-boggling to try and comprehend, and Junger communicates this in fascinating, raw detail while taking war politics out of it.
<br /><br/>

-[Demian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24861.Demian): 8.7
<br />
Thoughtful for coming of age, though not sure how much I'd like it on a reread.
<br /><br/>

-[The Dream of a Ridiculous Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/329866.The_Dream_of_a_Ridiculous_Man): 8.7
<br />
Enjoyed for similar reasons to White Nights. More fantastical, though still deeply colorful and thought-provoking.
<br /><br/>

-[No Longer Human](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194746.No_Longer_Human): 8.3
<br />
A moving story of life's hardships and feeling of alienation, though a bit long-winded at times.
<br /><br/>

-[The Social Animal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203968.The_Social_Animal): 8.5
<br />
A little larger than it needs to be, but incredibly transformative insofar as it made me challenge a lot more of my beliefs. As someone who has a good deal of skepticism about any non "hard" STEM field, I see this as a must-read for anyone looking to both understand, predict, and empathize better with other people as well as yourself.
<br /><br/>

-[God's Battalions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6072451-god-s-battalions): 8
<br />
Fascinating details of the crusades. Comes across as a bit biased at times but the simple details and stories of the battles and expeditions are truly something. Makes you wonder what it would've been like to be there.
<br /><br/>

-[The Best Short Stories of Anton Chekhov](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35699179-best-short-stories-of-anton-chekov): 8.6
<br />
Some stories in this collection are clear 9-9.5 material. Chekhov paints very "slice of life" and realistic portions of existence, all while being masterful in his use of prose and description. At one point, he describes a character's suffering heart as so full of misery, that if it were to burst, it would flood the whole world, and I feel it to be such a powerful description that it's made a new gold standard in my head.
<br /><br/>


-[The War of Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art): 8.3
<br />
A little simple, overly descriptive, and mystical at times. Sometimes it's quite hard to parse what's even being talekd about, and some ideas seem straight up contradictory. In terms of "literary quality", I wouldn't rate it so high. But however it managed to do so, I think about its message almost every day now. There's a voice in my head that says, "Resistance", and I know I have to beat it.
<br /><br/>

-[Principles: Life and Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles): 6.5
<br />
I liked this book a lot when I first read it, though I like it less over time. It's a very thoughtful book, but almost too thoughtful and repeptitive at that. To me it's a book that sounds good on paper, but actually seems unlikely to translate to a concrete improvement in whatever the person reading it hopes it'll be able to do.
<br /><br/>

-[The Lessons of History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History): 5
<br />
Overinundated with references and grand ideas, though presented at a pretty vague, abstract level and without particularly concrete conclusions/actionable takeaways. Perhaps something you can read if you want to feel some sense of smallness, but beyond that I feel like I didn't learn much or get convinced of anything too novel/useful.
