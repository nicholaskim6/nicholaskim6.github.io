# Music

Music is one of my greatest sources of enjoyment. The depth of raw, personal, and emotional experience it can give is like nothing else I know of. I like listening to all kinds, though I generally prefer more melodic things. As far as genres go, I particularly enjoy classical, japanese (especially soundtracks), indie, rock, and rnb. My favorite composer is Chopin.

My formal background is mainly in violin. I've played with the [National Youth Orchestra](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Programs/National-Youth-Ensembles/NYO-USA/NYO-USA-2016) and the [Princeton University Orchestra](https://orchestra.princeton.edu/), and I also briefly took lessons in piano.

<br />

In my free time, I enjoy writing music. Here are two of my classical-style piano pieces:

<br />

Etude No. 1 (not really an etude, but felt too long to call a prelude and wasn't sure what else it fit under)

# Gaming
I grew up first playing Blizzard classics like Diablo 2 and SC:BW and have been enjoying games ever since. I have a soft spot for any games with open-world, RPG, and/or story-driven elements and also enjoy team-focused/strategy games. In high school and college I played League of Legends competitively.

<br />

Single-player games I appreciate for their narratives, creative worlds, and emotional stories. I'm fond of how the agency in them makes for a special feeling of immersion and connection to characters. Multiplayer games I appreciate for their competitive thrill and social energy - there's nothing quite like watching an early GSL or LoL World's final.

# Other
I think anime is has a nice colorfulness, both literally and figuratively, that I find in short supply elsewhere. I don't watch too often, but when I do I try to make an occasion out of it and watch something that'll have lasting impact. As for other things, I've really enjoyed the (very) small handful of classic novels I've read, and I also have a passing interest in history.
