Eric Seiter and Joy Freid were sitting beside each other on a park bench beneath an oak tree. Eric, the son of an engineer, a forthright and tall man, who dreamed day and night about all that could go wrong in the world, gazed with tired eyes at the leaves in front of him. Joy, the daughter of an actor and actress, a quaint and kind-eyed girl, her hair neatly in a bun, with elegant posture, who dreamed of what more there was beyond, ran her fingers through the grass beside her.

There were many other benches around, but none of the passerbys cared to entertain them - they were too busy experiencing the distractions of a breeze. And perhaps those of the sun too, which was shining, but in a pensive way. It didn’t reveal its full face, but only what it cared to show through the streaks and gaps of the clouds.

Eric turned the corner of his eyes and looked at Joy. She was staring out at something ahead of her, possibly deep in thought, but possibly completely devoid of it as well. He noticed she was tapping her foot, which she tended to do out of habit. Her breaths seemed slow, as if she were preserving each one, and her mouth was quivered in a slightly lower position than normal. From the outside, it was impossible to tell whether she was happy or sad.

A scattered pale sea slowly clouded Eric’s vision. At first he saw only the form of a human against a waterfront. And then the charming expression of her eyes, and the brightness of the city lights across the river. He was sitting beside her, and, at long last, moved his hand onto hers, and an effusive, blinding affection pressed at the walls of his heart, with such breathlessness that he was sure if it were to burst, the whole world would fill with color.

Then he saw a walkway, leading up to a familiar hillside, and the same female figure in front of him, who hesitated to turn the other way, as if he’d just given her a kiss. And then the city fair where the two amused themselves on various rides and with a laughable portion of sweets. And then a night in an apartment, with her arm around his fast-beating chest, and the moonlight shining through the window. And then a park bench under an oak tree, with her at his side, with a partially overcast sky and many passerbys. And then a field, with many observers, where she was wearing a long, flowing white gown.

And then he saw the bitter tears that only affection could cause. He saw the struggles of the crushing debts they had both taken on, working tirelessly in the day and returning to a cold, destitute household at night. And the arguments over their daughter, Natalie, and the emotional toll caused by a tormenting sickness that nearly took her life. He saw how neither could sleep, and he saw the scars that would continue to grow deeper each week. He saw the death of her mother, and how afterwards, she no longer dreamed to see what was beyond, becoming resigned to the oppressive greys and gloom of the world. And then he saw the watered eyes and emotional yells of one night in what amounted to hours of anguish, reminscence, and hatred, where the color he’d once felt in his heart felt powerless to stop it. And then he saw her walking away, out the door, into the foggy field ahead, her form barely visible, his eyes scarcely open, unwilling to comprehend what they were seeing, his chest writhing in agony and sinking deeper into his stomach than he had ever felt before, in a way that made him regret his capacity to feel emotion, and a shaking on his shoulder. A shaking that wouldn’t stop, that continued to shake back and forth, more and more vigorously, until the sea of grey in his eyes dissolved, revealing the park and its bench once more.

Joy’s hand was on his shoulder, her eyes looking at his. A passing boy, as if deciding to entertain the wishes of the bench across from them, took a seat and fixated on his toy, and the rustling of leaves seemed to grow louder.
