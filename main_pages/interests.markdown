# Music

Music is one of my greatest sources of enjoyment. I like listening to all kinds, though I generally prefer more melodic/softer things. I particularly enjoy classical, japanese (especially soundtracks), indie, rock, and rnb. Some favorite artists include Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Liszt, Masashi Hamauzu, Yu-Peng Chen, Lamp, The Symposium, and Kanye West.

My formal background is mainly in violin. I've been a member of the [National Youth Orchestra](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Programs/National-Youth-Ensembles/NYO-USA/NYO-USA-2016) and the [Princeton University Orchestra](https://orchestra.princeton.edu/), and I also briefly took lessons in piano.

<br />

In my free time, I enjoy writing music. Here are two of my classical-style piano pieces:

<br />

Etude No. 1 (not really an etude, but felt too long to call a prelude and wasn't sure what else it fit under)

# Gaming
I grew up first playing Blizzard classics like Diablo 2 and SC:BW and have been enjoying games ever since. I have a soft spot for any games with open-world, RPG, and/or story-driven elements. I also enjoy team-focused/strategy games and played League of Legends competitively in high school and college.

<br />

I admire single player games for their narratives, creative worlds, and emotional stories, and multiplayer games for their competitive thrill and social energy. Some favorites include Bioshock Infinite, Spec Ops: The Line, Diablo 2, Starcraft 2, CoH, Fallout NV, and Dark Souls 3.

# Other
Anime has a particular place for me. I don't watch too often, but when I do I try to make an occasion out of it and watch something that will have a lasting impact on me. I appreciate anime's colorfulness, both literally and figuratively, and enjoy a lot of the culture surrounding it. Some favorites include Evangelion, Vivy Fluorite, and Kuzu no Honkai.

<br />

As for other things, I've really enjoyed the small handful of classic novels I've read. I also have a passing interest in war (particularly WW2) history. Reading about what soldiers experienced always puts things in perspective for me.
