Thanks for stopping by. I'm currently working as a software engineer at [Pahdo Labs](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pahdo-labs), where we're making an anime-themed MMORPG with an emphasis on user-generated content. Aside from engineering, I'm also working on the game's music direction and lore vision.
<br /><br />
I graduated from Princeton in 2021, where I mostly studied applied math and philosophy. I'm passionate about music, gaming, philosophy, and anything creative. I'm also interested in better understanding what creates meaningful connections between people.
