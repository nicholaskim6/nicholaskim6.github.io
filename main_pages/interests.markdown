# Music

Music is one of my greatest sources of enjoyment. I like listening to all kinds, though I generally prefer more melodic things. As far as genres go, I particularly enjoy classical, japanese (especially soundtracks), indie rock/pop, and rnb. My favorite composer is Chopin.

<br />

My formal background is mainly in violin. I've played with the [National Youth Orchestra](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Programs/National-Youth-Ensembles/NYO-USA/NYO-USA-2016) and [Princeton University Orchestra](https://orchestra.princeton.edu/), and I also briefly took lessons in piano.

<br />

In my free time, I enjoy writing music.

# Gaming
I grew up first playing Blizzard classics like Diablo 2 and SC:BW and have been enjoying games ever since. I have a soft spot for any games with open-world, RPG, and/or story-driven elements and also enjoy team-focused/strategy games. In high school and college I played League of Legends competitively.

<br />

I appreciate single player games for their narratives, creative worlds, and emotional stories. I'm fond of how the agency in them makes for a special immersion and connection to characters, and my favorite game is Bioshock Infinite. Spec Ops: The Line, The Last of Us, and Dark Souls 3 are other games I've heavily enjoyed. Multiplayer games I appreciate for their competitive thrill and social energy, with my favorites being League, Starcraft 2, and Company of Heroes.

# Other
I think anime has a nice colorfulness, both literally and figuratively, that I find in short supply elsewhere. Evangelion remains my favorite after many years, and I still find myself thinking about its portrayals of human emotion. Some other things I enjoy are short stories, World War 1/2 history, and long walks.
