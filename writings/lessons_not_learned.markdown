###### Lessons Not Learned

i wish i'd done this earlier, but not really

Going through an experience and coming out the other side with nothing to show for isn't something anyone wants. It's hard enough that the temptation to _feel_ like
you've learned something, even if you haven't, usually precedence. I think this an endemic issue with how people, myself included, go about forming their world views. You make mistakes, you feel the consequences, and your inner you wants desperately to feel like it wasn't for nothing - that you at least understand why it happened and that, equipped with only your new wisdom and not foresight, you could go back and do better.

More often than not though, the argument and lessons are overly broad and lack concrete data. There'll be a satisfying, logical flow to the argument and conclusions, but you'll probably find something equally satisfying to hear arguing for the opposite direction as well. This effect is especially strong when it comes to negative experiences, so take advice related to regrets, both from yourself and others, with a grain of salt.
