# Music

Music is one of my greatest sources of enjoyment. The depth of raw, personal, and emotional experience it can give is like nothing else I know of. I like listening to all kinds, though I generally prefer more melodic things. I particularly enjoy classical, japanese (especially soundtracks), indie, rock, and rnb. Some favorite artists include Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Liszt, Scriabin, Masashi Hamauzu, Yu-Peng Chen, Lamp, The Symposium, and Kanye West.

My formal background is mainly in violin. I've played with the [National Youth Orchestra](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Programs/National-Youth-Ensembles/NYO-USA/NYO-USA-2016) and the [Princeton University Orchestra](https://orchestra.princeton.edu/), and I also briefly took lessons in piano.

In my free time, I enjoy writing music. Here are two of my classical-style piano pieces:

<br />

Etude No. 1 (not really an etude, but felt too long to call a prelude and wasn't sure what else it fit under)

# Gaming
I grew up first playing Blizzard classics like Diablo 2 and SC:BW and have been enjoying games ever since. I have a soft spot for any games with open-world, RPG, and/or story-driven elements. I also enjoy team-focused/strategy games and played League of Legends competitively in high school and college.

<br />

I admire single player games for their narratives, creative worlds, and emotional stories, and enjoy how the agency in them makes for a really special feeling of immersion and connection to characters. Multiplayer games I like for their competitive thrill and social energy. The communal spirit around them and the lows and highs of competition are always inspiring to be a part of.

<br />

Some favorite titles include Bioshock Infinite, Spec Ops: The Line, Diablo 2, Starcraft 2, CoH, Fallout NV, and Dark Souls 3.

# Other
I think anime is a wonderfully unique medium/style. It has a colorfulness, both literally and figuratively, that I find in short supply elsewhere. I don't watch too often, but when I do I try to make an occasion out of it and watch something that'll have lasting impact. Some favorites include Evangelion, Vivy Fluorite, and Kuzu no Honkai. 

<br />

As for other things, I've really enjoyed the (very) small handful of classic novels I've read and also have a passing interest in war history (reading about what soldiers experienced always puts things in perspective). At some point I'd like to learn how to draw and 2d/3d animate.
