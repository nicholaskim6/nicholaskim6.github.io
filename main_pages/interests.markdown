# Music

Music is one of my greatest sources of enjoyment. I like listening to all kinds, though I generally prefer more melodic/softer things. I particularly enjoy classical, japanese (especially soundtracks), indie, rock, and rnb. Some favorite artists include Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Liszt, Scriabin, Masashi Hamauzu, Yu-Peng Chen, Lamp, The Symposium, and Kanye West.

My formal background is mainly in violin. I've played with the [National Youth Orchestra](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Programs/National-Youth-Ensembles/NYO-USA/NYO-USA-2016) and the [Princeton University Orchestra](https://orchestra.princeton.edu/), and I also briefly took lessons in piano.

In my free time, I enjoy writing music. Here are two of my classical-style piano pieces:

<br />

Etude No. 1 (not really an etude, but felt too long to call a prelude and wasn't sure what else it fit under)

# Gaming
I grew up first playing Blizzard classics like Diablo 2 and SC:BW and have been enjoying games ever since. I have a soft spot for any games with open-world, RPG, and/or story-driven elements. I also enjoy team-focused/strategy games and played League of Legends competitively in high school and college.

<br />

I like single player games for their narratives, creative worlds, and emotional stories, and multiplayer games for their competitive thrill and social energy. Some favorites include Bioshock Infinite, Spec Ops: The Line, Diablo 2, Starcraft 2, CoH, Fallout NV, and Dark Souls 3.

# Other
I also really enjoy anime/anime-related things. I don't watch too often, but when I do I try to make an occasion out of it and watch something that'll have lasting impact. Some favorites include Evangelion, Vivy Fluorite, and Kuzu no Honkai. I've also really enjoyed the small handful of classic novels I've read and have a passing interest in war history (reading about what soldiers experienced always puts things in perspective for me). At some point I'd like to learn how to draw and 2d/3d animate.
